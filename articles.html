    <h4>Chill Out for Your Back's Sake</h4>
    <p>It is easy to do, you can easily find yourself get stressed and crunched for time which no matter how many times you try you cannot
        become anymore productive. But have you ever thought about just forcing yourself to take a break and relax? Well you should! </p>
    <p>A recent study noted that people who were more likely to take a break every 2 hours of at least 10 minutes were less likely to be
    injured. But why does taking breaks means a more vigorous immune system? Its because the stress hormone cortisol, which is linked to
    fat build up as well, prioritizes itself for immeadiate threats and lets the immune system bare the brunt of the reallocation overhead.</p>

    <h4>Use Red Light Filters to Get A Good Sleep</h4>
    <p>Sleep is an important time for our bodies to catch up with us and is incredibly useful for a variety of physiological
    processes. Therefore we need to make sure we are doing everything in our power to get as much sleep as we need every
    night of the week. One reason some people have trouble sleeping is because the brain can't tell when its lights out when
    you are staring at your phone for hours. </p>
        <p>The best way to mitigate this unpleasant rammification of your digital lifestyle is with filters that strip the red
        light from the screen. More blue light in your eyes than red creates an effect similar to moon and help cue the body
        that it is time to start shutting down and get ready for the excitement tomorrow will bring!</p>

        <h4>Diet and Health: An Obvious Pair</h4>
<p>While you shouldn't be shocked to hear it, it is worth stating that your health and your diet are intimately tied together.
This doesn't mean that by eating "diet" food or carefully counting your calories are the only way to good health, as exercise
also builds self-discipline but in a much healthier way than dieting alone. </p>
            <h5>But What to Eat?</h5>
            <p>There are hundreds of diets out there claiming to give you rapid results so long as your eat their brand's
            barely edible cardboard, so how do you know which one? Different people of course tend to respond differently
            to each diet, wehave found the best advise we can give is for each person to learn her body and repond to what 
            it is telling you. No easy task, to learn the self, but there is no more useful skill to have. And lucky for you
                we offer classes on THAT EXACTLY</p>
